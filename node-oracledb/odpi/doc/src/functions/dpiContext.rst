ODPI-C Context Functions
------------------------

Context handles are the top level handles created by the library and are used
for all error handling as well as creating pools and standalone connections to
the database. The first call to ODPI-C by any application must be
:func:`dpiContext_createWithParams()` which will create the context as well as
validate the version used by the application.  Context handles are destroyed by
using the function :func:`dpiContext_destroy()`.

.. function:: int dpiContext_createWithParams(unsigned int majorVersion, \
        unsigned int minorVersion, dpiContextCreateParams* params, \
        dpiContext** context, dpiErrorInfo* errorInfo)

    Creates a new context for interaction with the library. This is the first
    function that must be called and it must have completed successfully before
    any other functions can be called, including in other threads.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.
    If a failure occurs, the errorInfo structure is filled in with error
    information.

    *NOTE*: The function dpiContext_create() was replaced by a macro in version
    4 which calls this function with params set to the value NULL.

    **majorVersion** [IN] -- the major version of the ODPI-C library that is
    being used by the application. This should always be the constant value
    DPI_MAJOR_VERSION defined in the dpi.h being used by the application. It
    must match the major version of the ODPI-C library that is being linked to
    the application.

    **minorVersion** [IN] -- the minor version of the ODPI-C library that is
    being used by the application. This should always be the constant value
    DPI_MINOR_VERSION defined in the dpi.h being used by the application. It
    must be less than or equal to the minor version of the ODPI-C library that
    is being linked to the application.

    **params** [IN] -- a pointer to a
    :ref:`dpiContextCreateParams<dpiContextCreateParams>` structure containing
    parameters used to modify how ODPI-C loads the Oracle Client library.
    Although it is possible to create multiple contexts, only the first context
    created will use these parameters. This value can also be NULL in which
    case default parameters will be used.

    **context** [OUT] -- a pointer to a context handle which will be populated
    upon successful completion of this function.

    **errorInfo** [OUT] -- a pointer to a :ref:`dpiErrorInfo<dpiErrorInfo>`
    structure which will be populated with error information if an error takes
    place during the execution of this function. If no error takes place, the
    structure is not modified in any way. Note that the only members of the
    structure that should be examined when an error occurs are message,
    messageLength, encoding, fnName and action.


.. function:: int dpiContext_destroy(dpiContext* context)

    Destroys the context that was earlier created with the function
    :func:`dpiContext_createWithParams()`.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **context** [IN] -- the context handle which should be destroyed. If the
    handle is NULL or invalid an error is returned.


.. function:: int dpiContext_getClientVersion(const dpiContext* context, \
        dpiVersionInfo* versionInfo)

    Return information about the version of the Oracle Client that is being
    used.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **context** [IN] -- the context handle created earlier using the function
    :func:`dpiContext_createWithParams()`. If the handle is NULL or invalid an
    error is returned.

    **versionInfo** [OUT] -- a pointer to a
    :ref:`dpiVersionInfo<dpiVersionInfo>` structure which will be populated
    with the version information of the Oracle Client being used.


.. function:: void dpiContext_getError(const dpiContext* context, \
        dpiErrorInfo* errorInfo)

    Returns information for the last error or warning that was raised by the
    library. This function must be called with the same thread that generated
    the error or warning. It must also be called before any other ODPI-C
    library calls are made on the calling thread since the error/warning
    information specific to that thread is cleared at the start of every ODPI-C
    function call.

    **context** [IN] -- the context handle created earlier using the function
    :func:`dpiContext_createWithParams()`. If the handle is NULL or invalid the
    error information is populated with an invalid context handle error
    instead.

    **errorInfo** [OUT] -- a pointer to a :ref:`dpiErrorInfo<dpiErrorInfo>`
    structure which will be populated with information about the last error
    or warning that was raised. If a warning was raised, the
    :member:`dpiErrorInfo.isWarning` flag will be set to the value 1.


.. function:: int dpiContext_initCommonCreateParams( \
        const dpiContext* context, dpiContextParams* params)

    Initializes the :ref:`dpiCommonCreateParams<dpiCommonCreateParams>`
    structure to default values.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **context** [IN] -- the context handle created earlier using the function
    :func:`dpiContext_createWithParams()`. If the handle is NULL or invalid an
    error is returned.

    **params** [OUT] -- a pointer to a
    :ref:`dpiCommonCreateParams<dpiCommonCreateParams>` structure which will be
    populated with default values upon completion of this function.

.. function:: int dpiContext_initConnCreateParams( \
        const dpiContext* context, dpiConnCreateParams* params)

    Initializes the :ref:`dpiConnCreateParams<dpiConnCreateParams>` structure
    to default values.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **context** [IN] -- the context handle created earlier using the function
    :func:`dpiContext_createWithParams()`. If the handle is NULL or invalid an
    error is returned.

    **params** [OUT] -- a pointer to a
    :ref:`dpiConnCreateParams<dpiConnCreateParams>` structure which will be
    populated with default values upon completion of this function.


.. function:: int dpiContext_initPoolCreateParams( \
        const dpiContext* context, dpiPoolCreateParams* params)

    Initializes the :ref:`dpiPoolCreateParams<dpiPoolCreateParams>` structure
    to default values.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **context** [IN] -- the context handle created earlier using the function
    :func:`dpiContext_createWithParams()`. If the handle is NULL or invalid an
    error is returned.

    **params** [OUT] -- a pointer to a
    :ref:`dpiPoolCreateParams<dpiPoolCreateParams>` structure which will be
    populated with default values upon completion of this function.


.. function:: int dpiContext_initSodaOperOptions( \
        const dpiContext* context, dpiSodaOperOptions* options)

    Initializes the :ref:`dpiSodaOperOptions<dpiSodaOperOptions>`
    structure to default values.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **context** [IN] -- the context handle created earlier using the function
    :func:`dpiContext_createWithParams()`. If the handle is NULL or invalid an
    error is returned.

    **options** [OUT] -- a pointer to a
    :ref:`dpiSodaOperOptions<dpiSodaOperOptions>` structure which will be
    populated with default values upon completion of this function.


.. function:: int dpiContext_initSubscrCreateParams( \
        const dpiContext* context, dpiSubscrCreateParams* params)

    Initializes the :ref:`dpiSubscrCreateParams<dpiSubscrCreateParams>`
    structure to default values.

    The function returns DPI_SUCCESS for success and DPI_FAILURE for failure.

    **context** [IN] -- the context handle created earlier using the function
    :func:`dpiContext_createWithParams()`. If the handle is NULL or invalid an
    error is returned.
