 * NAME
 *   182. deferLibInit.js
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *   Test deferring initialization of ODPI-C library.
 *   This is a node-oracledb v3.1+ feature.
 *
 *   Note: These tests will not succeed unless LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used to
 *         point to the path of Oracle Instant Client. Please also make sure
 *         you don't have any other Oracle Clients installed except for that
 *         sepcified by LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
